# Design Principles

## Q:= What are the types of design principles?
Ans:= There are five types of design principles:
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

## Q:= What is Single Responsibility Principle?
Ans:= The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. If a class has more than one job, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results in modification of the other responsibility. This principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. 

## Q:= What is Open/Closed Principle?
Ans:= The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code. This principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. 

## Q:= What is Liskov Substitution Principle?
Ans:= The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program. This principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## Q:= What is Interface Segregation Principle?
Ans:= The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use. This principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## Q:= What is Dependency Inversion Principle?
Ans:= The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## Q:= What is the difference between design patterns and design principles?
Ans:= Design principles are general rules and guidelines that are used to design software. Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that occur in software design. Design principles are used to guide the design of software. Design patterns are used to solve common problems that occur in software design. Design principles are used to make the software design more robust, flexible, and maintainable. Design patterns are used to make the software design more reusable, scalable, and efficient.

## Q:= What is the DRYS principle?
Ans:= The DRYS principle stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. It is a software development principle that states that every piece of knowledge or logic in a software system should be stored in a single, unambiguous place. This principle is aimed at reducing redundancy and improving maintainability. The DRY principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change.

## Q:= What is the KISS principle?
Ans:= The KISS principle stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid. It is a design principle that states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. This principle is aimed at reducing complexity and improving maintainability. The KISS principle is closely related to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Q:= What is the YAGNI principle?
Ans:= The YAGNI principle stands for You Aren't Gonna Need It. It is a software development principle that states that a programmer should not add functionality until it is needed. This principle is aimed at reducing complexity and improving maintainability. The YAGNI principle is closely related to the Interface Segregation Principle, which states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface that it does not use.

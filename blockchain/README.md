# Blockchain

The blockchain works by storing a chain of blocks, each of which contains a timestamp, data, and a hash of the previous block. The hash of each block is calculated using a cryptographic hash function, which ensures that the block cannot be tampered with without changing its hash.

To add a new block to the blockchain, a node must first solve a cryptographic puzzle. The puzzle is designed to be difficult to solve, but easy to verify. Once a node solves the puzzle, it broadcasts the new block to the rest of the network. The other nodes then verify the new block and add it to their own copies of the blockchain.

The blockchain is a distributed ledger, which means that it is stored on multiple nodes in the network. This makes it very difficult to tamper with the blockchain, as any changes would have to be made to all of the copies of the blockchain.

Here is how the blockchain works in simple terms:

A new block is created.
The hash of the new block is calculated.
The new block is broadcast to the network.
The other nodes verify the new block.
The new block is added to the blockchain.

# Channels in Golang

Imagine you have a group of 5 friends who are all working on different tasks. They all want to share their progress with each other, but they don't want to interrupt each other. How can they do this?

They could use a channel. A channel is like a pipe that allows data to be passed between goroutines. Each friend could put their progress in the channel, and then the other friends could take the progress out of the channel. This would allow them to share their progress without interrupting each other.

In Golang, goroutines are like the friends in this example. They are lightweight threads that can run concurrently. Channels are like the pipes that allow them to communicate with each other.

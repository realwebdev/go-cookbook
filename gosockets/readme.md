refreshing the page for checking if the task is implemented or not. websockets were introduced in 2011. It is a protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is used in web applications to provide real-time communication between a client and a server. It is a two-way communication protocol that allows the client and server to send messages to each other at any time. It is used in applications that require real-time updates, such as chat applications, online gaming, and live streaming. Websockets are supported by all modern web browsers and can be used with any web framework or programming language that supports them.

# Buffers in Golang

"Buffering is a technique used to improve the performance of I/O operations by temporarily storing data in memory before reading or writing it. Instead of reading or writing data one byte at a time, a buffered reader or writer reads or writes data in larger chunks, reducing the overhead of system calls."
